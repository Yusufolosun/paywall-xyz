        <h1>The Future of Content Monetization</h1>
        <p class="meta">By Demo Author • February 15, 2026</p>

        <div class="preview">
            <p>Content creators have long struggled with finding sustainable ways to monetize their work. Traditional
                advertising models favor large platforms, while subscription paywalls create barriers for casual
                readers.</p>

            <p>What if there was a better way? A system that allowed readers to pay for individual pieces of content
                they value, without the friction of creating accounts or managing subscriptions?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="premium" data-paywall-id="1" data-paywall-price="0.5">
            <h2>Micropayments: The Solution</h2>

            <p>Blockchain technology enables true micropayments for the first time in internet history. With Stacks,
                readers can unlock content for as little as $0.50, paying directly from their crypto wallet.</p>

            <h3>Benefits for Creators</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep 90% of all revenue</li>
                <li>No monthly platform fees</li>
                <li>Instant settlement of payments</li>
                <li>Full ownership of content and audience</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Benefits for Readers</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Pay only for what you read</li>
                <li>No account creation required</li>
                <li>Support creators directly</li>
                <li>Cryptographic proof of purchase</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>The process is simple: when you click the unlock button, your Stacks wallet opens. Approve the
                transaction, and the content unlocks immediately. Your payment is recorded on the blockchain, giving you
                permanent access.</p>

            <p>This demo uses PayWall.xyz, a drop-in widget that any website can integrate in just 3 lines of code. The
                smart contract ensures creators receive their revenue automatically, with no intermediaries.</p>

            <h2>The Future</h2>
            <p>As blockchain technology matures, we expect micropayments to become the dominant model for online
                content. Readers gain freedom from subscriptions, while creators earn sustainable income without
                sacrificing their independence.</p>
